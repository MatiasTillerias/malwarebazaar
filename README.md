# Malware Bazaar CLI
> Author: Mat√≠as Tillerias ley (1Fy53c)

I'm starting with malware analysis and I understand the people who are starting with me, and they don't know where to look for some free samples to begin to study; after some research, I found a site called "Malware Bazaar", a place with thousand of malware and a friendly API, so I decided to create this little software to look and download malware

## how to use

|Flag|Argument|
|:--:|:--:|
|-f --filter| If you use this flag you will look for malware with the tag that you wrote|
|--hash| If you use this flag you will download a specific malware looking for it by his SHA256 hash|
|-l --list| Look for the samples added in the last hour|

## how to install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
